# Deep-Textures-TensorFlow
This is a derivative of the NIPS 2015 texture synthesis project that utilizes multiple images to better the result.

#TODO:

i.  Tidy up the code:
      -Remove excess methods
      -Comment extensively
      -Characterize every part

ii. Testing:
      -Run more iterations
      -Use more complex images
