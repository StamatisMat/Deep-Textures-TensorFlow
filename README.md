# Deep-Textures-TensorFlow
This is a derivative of the NIPS 2015 texture synthesis project that utilizes multiple images to better the result.

#TODO:

i.  Tidy up the code:
      -Remove excess methods         \/
      -Comment extensively           half check

ii. Testing:
      -Run more iterations           More => never complete so no checks til the end of time
      -Use more complex images       half check
